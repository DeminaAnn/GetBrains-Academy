// Description
// We can carry on and make things more interesting, can't we?
// Let's improve the program so it can do multiple actions, one after another.
// It must repeatedly ask users what they want to do. Users can input either buy, fill, take,
// and then the program does the same thing it did in the previous step.
// However, if users want to turn off the coffee machine, they should type in exit.
// The program terminates after this command. Also, when users type in remaining,
// the program should output all coffee machine resources. This means that you shouldn't show the remaining
// stock levels at the beginning/end of the program.

// Objectives
// Write a program that continuously makes coffee for everyone until the shutdown command is provided.
// Introduce two new options: remaining and exit

// Do not forget that you can overstretch your supplies while making coffee.
// If the coffee machine doesn't have enough resources to make coffee, the program should output a message
// saying that it can't make it anymore and state what is missing.

// And the last improvement to the program at this step â€” if users enter to buy a cup of coffee
// but change their mind afterward, allow them to input to return to the main menu.buyback

// Set the following initial supplies: 400 ml of water, 540 ml of milk, 120 g of coffee beans,
// 9 disposable cups, $550.
